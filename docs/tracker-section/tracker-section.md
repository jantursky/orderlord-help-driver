## Description
The section is allowing the courier to preview the map of his last paths also with the date+time, when he was on this position. The courier could also vizualize the path of the courier with {% include icon.html name="directions_car" %} the animated car icon.

<span class="text-red-200">The number of last positions logged is limited, depending on the device. Once the application was uninstalled, or the cache of the application was deleted (through device Settings), **these locations will be deleted**.</span>
