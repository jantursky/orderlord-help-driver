## How to change the type
If the courier needs to change the payment type, he could do that on the screen **Order on the map**. He needs to click on the payment type area and the list of the payment types will be shown on the bottom of the screen. Once he will find the appropriate payment type, he needs to click on that type, the update information for the order will be send to the server and update the payment type of the order.

<span class="text-red-200">For some accounts, the option **CHANGE THE PAYMENT TYPE** could be disabled. This is because of the set up of the account. In such case, you need to ask the administrator of the account (_you need to ask for the access_)</span>
