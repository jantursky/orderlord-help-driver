## What is the Battery Optimization
Broadly speaking, the Android platform provides two categories of help for you to optimize your app's battery use. First, it provides several APIs that you can implement in your app. You can learn more about these APIs in Guide to background processing.

There are also internal mechanisms in the platform to help conserve battery life. While they are not APIs that you implement programmatically, you should still be aware of them so that your app can leverage them successfully. For more information, see:
- **Doze and App Standby**
- **App Standby Buckets** - the system limits apps' access to device resources like the CPU or battery, based on the user's usage patterns.
- **Background restrictions** - if an app exhibits bad behaviors, the system prompts the user to restrict that app's access to system resources.
- **Power management restrictions** - see a list of power restrictions that can be imposed on apps under certain conditions.

## How to DISABLE Battery optimization
You have the option to disable this option on the login screen. On the Driver screen is also displaying the warning notification label, which is informing that you should disable the optimization.
