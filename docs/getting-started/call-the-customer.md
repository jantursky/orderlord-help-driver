## How to call the customer
The courier can call the customer by clicking on the <span class="text-green-200">**green circle button**</span> {% include icon.html name="call" %}. This will initiate opening the external call application and **CALL** the customer. If the phone number is in the wrong format, by long-click on the enabled row, the list of options will be displayed with the options:
- **Call the customer**
- **Edit the phone number before calling the customer** - this option will open a new dialog, where the courier can change the phone number before the call
