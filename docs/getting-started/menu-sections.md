## How to display menu
To display the menu with all available sections, the user could do that 2. ways:
- click on the {% include icon.html name="menu" %} **hamburger icon**, left block with pulled to the foreground
- **or** the user needs to hold the left part of the screen **to the right** {% include icon.html name="chevron_right" %}

## List of options

1. {% include icon.html name="motorcycle" %} [**Deliveries**]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/getting-started/how-to-use-the-driver-screen.md %}) - the main screen for the cook, displaying the list of deliveries, orders, and meals. The cook has the option to setup a meal as <span class="text-orange-200">**cooked**</span>/<span class="text-green-200">**prepared**</span>, finish the order, cancel the order, reset the order and even more.
1. {% include icon.html name="history" %} [**History**]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/history-section/history-section.md %}) - same as the **Kitchen** section, without the option to set meal as <span class="text-orange-200">**cooked**</span>/<span class="text-green-200">**prepared**</span>. The section is displaying the active orders, future orders but also **orders, where meals were already cooked/prepared.**
1. {% include icon.html name="timeline" %} [**Timeline**]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/timeline-section/timeline-section.md %}) - the list of last actions that the cook performs during working with the kitchen application sorted by the date and time.
1. {% include icon.html name="person_pin_circle" %} [**Tracker**]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/tracker-section/tracker-section.md %}) - option to find orders depending on the specific filter or by order ID, partner system ID of the order or phone number.
1. {% include icon.html name="donut_large" %} [**Overview**]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/overview-section/overview-section.md %}) - the user can set the flag for a meal that is no longer available in the kitchen (all supplies for the meal were spent)
1. {% include icon.html name="people" %} [**Team**]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/team-section/team-section.md %}) - the user can set the flag for a meal that is no longer available in the kitchen (all supplies for the meal were spent)
1. {% include icon.html name="settings" %} [**Settings**]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/list-of-settings/list-of-settings.md %}) - list of many settings, which are for design, data, appearance and information purposes
1. {% include icon.html name="power_settings_new" %} [**Logout**]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/getting-started/how-to-logout.md %}) - the current user will be logged
