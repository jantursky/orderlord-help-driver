## Description
The courier could adjust, what is the map service, he wants to use. Whether it is:
- [**Google Maps**](https://www.google.com/maps) - this map layer has also the option to customize it, like _night mode_, _traffic_, _buildings visibility_, etc.
- [**Mapbox**](https://www.mapbox.com/)
- [**OpenStreetMap**](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) - this map layer is open-source, so because of it, it could loads the map a bit slower, but the speed isn't such significantly
