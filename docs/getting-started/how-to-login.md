## Basic login
- Open the application **"Orderlord Driver"**. The new screen will be displayed. You could notice, that for the first time, you need to enable some permissions or allow access for some features for proper working of the application:
	- {% include icon.html name="battery_alert" %} **Battery Optimization** - for better working of background services, like GPS localization and sending/received updates. [You could solve it in this section](#disable-battery-optimization)
	- {% include icon.html name="block" %} **AutoStart** - this is feature specific for some vendors, like Xiaomi, Letv, Honor, Oppo, Vivo, Huawei, Samsung, Asus etc. This feature is allowing long running background services to be not shutting down once they are running too long. [You could solve it in this section](#enable-autostart)
	- {% include icon.html name="volume_off" %} **Do not Disturb mode** - feature, that will turn down the sounds/notifications for all applications. [You could solve it in this section](#allow-access-for-do-not-disturb-mode)
