## How to use the Kitchen screen
1. Once the orders with food, which need to be cooked/prepared, is displayed in the list, the user could start to cook/prepare the food. At this moment, you don't need to click on anything. At the moment when you, as the user in charge of cooking food (in this case **"Chicken"**), have the food <span class="text-orange-200">**cooked**</span>, you can click on the row with that food. If you have <span class="text-orange-200">**cooked**</span> all the quantity of this food (in this case **"Chicken"**, for instance, if there is **0/3**), then you could click as many times on the row, as you have <span class="text-orange-200">**cooked**</span> this specific food (let's say **3x**). The status of this item will be set as it is <span class="text-orange-200">**cooked**</span> and the orange label will display on the right side.

1. Once the meal is <span class="text-orange-200">**cooked**</span>, the user could start to <span class="text-green-200">**prepare**</span> the meal (packed it for the customer, prepare to serve the customer). The same principle as for <span class="text-orange-200">**cooked**</span>, click on the row as many times, as the meal has quantity.
