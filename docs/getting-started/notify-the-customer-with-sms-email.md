## How to notify the customer
If the courier needs to notify the customer, with one of predefined messages, he could do that through **SMS/e-mail**. On the screen **Order on the map**, he needs to click on the {% include icon.html name="email" %} **notify**, the dialog with the options will be shown.

The courier could select if he wants to send {% include icon.html name="sms" %} **SMS** or {% include icon.html name="email" %} **e-mail** or the combination of both. The e-mail option is enabled to be selected only if the customer added the e-mail information. The courier needs to select the way to contact the customer by clicking on **SMS or/and e-mail**. If he wants to change the predefined message, which will be sent to the customer, he could do that by clicking on the row with the message.

The list of messages will be displayed from the bottom and he could change that. The courier could also increase or decrease the time information, which will be included (replaced the placeholder) in the message for the customer. Once the courier has prepared the message, he needs to click on the <span class="text-orange-200">**SEND MESSAGE**</span> button.
